## Neo4j Notes

```cypher
CREATE (ee:Person { name: "Emil", from: "Sweden", klout: 99 })
```

```cypher
MATCH (ee:Person) WHERE ee.name = "Emil" RETURN ee;
```

`CREATE ` clause to create data

`()` parenthesis to indicate a node

`ee:Person ` a variable 'ee' and label 'Person' for the new node

`{} ` brackets to add properties to the node

`MATCH ` clause to specify a pattern of nodes and relationships

`(ee:Person) ` a single node pattern with label 'Person' which will assign matches to the variable 'ee'

`WHERE ` clause to constrain the results

`ee.name = "Emil" ` compares name property to the value "Emil" 

`RETURN ` clause used to request particular results

```cypher
MATCH (ee:Person) WHERE ee.name = "Emil" CREATE (js:Person { name: "Johan", from: "Sweden", learn: "surfing" }), (ir:Person { name: "Ian", from: "England", title: "author" }), (rvb:Person { name: "Rik", from: "Belgium", pet: "Orval" }), (ally:Person { name: "Allison", from: "California", hobby: "surfing" }), (ee)-[:KNOWS {since: 2001}]->(js),(ee)-[:KNOWS {rating: 5}]->(ir), (js)-[:KNOWS]->(ir),(js)-[:KNOWS]->(rvb), (ir)-[:KNOWS]->(js),(ir)-[:KNOWS]->(ally), (rvb)-[:KNOWS]->(ally)
```

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p;
```

If you want to delete the nodes, you should delete the relationships that connected to them first.

```cypher
MATCH (ee:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-()-[r1:KNOWS]-(p:Person) WHERE ee.name = "Johan" DELETE r,r1;
```

```cypher
MATCH (ee:Person) DELETE ee;
```

```cypher
MATCH (ee:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(friends) WHERE ee.name = "Emil" RETURN ee, friends
```

![](/assets/img/posts/neo4j_notes/output4.PNG)

`MATCH ` clause to describe the pattern from known Nodes to found Nodes

`(ee) ` starts the pattern with a Person (qualified by WHERE)

`-[:KNOWS]- ` matches "KNOWS" relationships (in either direction)

`(friends) ` will be bound to Emil's friends

```cypher
MATCH (js:Person)-[:KNOWS]-()-[:KNOWS]-(surfer) WHERE js.name = "Johan" AND surfer.hobby = "surfing" RETURN DISTINCT surfer
```
